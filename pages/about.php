				<strong>The York University / Sheridan College Joint Program in Design</strong> is the first
        and largest Bachelor of Design Honours program in Ontario.
        Over the past four years, we, as YSDN students, have been educated in different practices of
        design. We have come together with our knowledge and experiences in creating our grad show.
		</p>
			<p>
				It has been an exciting journey of growth through practice, experimentation
				and collaboration. Join us at the York/Sheridan Pique Grad Show as
				we share the work of our 2012 graduates and celebrate a promising future.
