				<strong>The York University / Sheridan College Joint Program in Design</strong> is the first
				and largest Bachelor of Design Honours program in Ontario. Over
				the past four years, we, as YSDN students have developed a unique
				voice within our work that we understand as the method through
				which we approach our discipline.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has been an exciting journey of growth through practice, experimentation
				and collaboration. Join us at the York/Sheridan Pique Grad Show as
				we share the work of our 2012 graduates and celebrate a promising future.
